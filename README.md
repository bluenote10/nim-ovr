## nim-ovr

Nim bindings for the Oculus Rift (libOVR).

### Note

These bindings are for libOVR version 0.5.0.1, the "last" version with Linux/OSX support.
The bindings do not provide the entire functionality.
I have omitted unnecessary things, which have been removed in version 0.6.0.0 anyway.
Unfortunately, Oculus VR have "paused" Linux/OSX support starting with version 0.6.0.0.
I will not move to 0.6.0.0+ as long as cross-platform development is not possible.

### Sample Application

A sample application using these bindings is available [here](https://github.com/bluenote10/NimOculusRiftExample).
